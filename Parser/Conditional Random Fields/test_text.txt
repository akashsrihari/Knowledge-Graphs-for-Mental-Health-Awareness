As a Certified Group Psychotherapist (CGP) with extensive personal and professional experience in group therapy, I am a huge fan of its effectiveness. Group therapy offers an economical adjunct to individual therapy. By sharing stories and emotions with others, you become aware that human pain and problems are a universal experience, and not unique to any one person. Group provides the context to begin the healing process by actually "practicing" how to reconnect with our authentic self and others on deeper levels in feeling less alone.
The group is designed to provide both psycho-education and support. Members will work together to process emotional experiences, discuss triggers, and identify coping. Members will also learn to cope with emotional reactivity, mood swings, impulsive behavior, and learn effective communication and interpersonal skills.

Recovery from sexual addiction (pornography, chat rooms, etc) is achieved through becoming accountable to other men and choosing to live one's life without the destructive behaviors.  Recovery begins by realizing our powerlessness to stop the behavior by ourselves. A typical meeting consists of a combination of "checking in," focused teaching, sharing struggles, and processing weekly assigned work from "Facing the Shadow" workbook (or other handouts) and a time of discussing whatever issues group members may be facing. Throughout the group, each man will have the opportunity to share his story, his struggle, and seek support from other group members.
